In 1.2 upgrade done:

 - Loads settings (settings.cpp, new format!)
 - Opens audio source (audiosource.cpp)
 - Creates and initializes encoder(s) (encoder.cpp)
 - Audio source in GUI works
 - Encoder list in GUI works

Currently missing functionality:

 - Encoders connection to streaming server untested
 - Actual streaming
 - Audio adjustments
 - Rest of GUI

----

Other todo's:

* Better error handling
 - Reconnect on server drop
 - Don't block on send (handle temporary packetloss, slowdown, etc)

* Non-device sources (named pipes, whatever)
 - Need somekinda timing code to stay at right speed (easy to do)

* Cleanup some parts
 - Source handling could be better (multiple sources(?), non-device sources)

* Change proxy definition in config to "hostname:port" (easy)

* Ogg vorbis support

...

* Add a lot of other things, + refactoring
