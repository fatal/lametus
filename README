README for lametus 1.1

What is lametus
---------------

Lametus is a realtime mp3 streamer. It uses LAME <http://www.mp3dev.org/> as
encoder backend.

First version of lametus was made around 2000, the current version is 
a continuation effort including new features. The interface has right now
a hack'ish ncurses "multimedia" option with somekind of limiter/compressor.
