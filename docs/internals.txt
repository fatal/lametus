Adding support for new audio source types
-----------------------------------------

See audio.h, you need to implement the following functions:

struct audio_source *audio_source_create(void);
void audio_source_init(struct audio_source *);
void audio_source_read(struct audio_source *,unsigned char *,int);

audio_source_create() should allocate a "struct audio_source" and fill it with
reasonable default values.

audio_source_init() should open the audio device and setup it for recording.

audio_source_read() should read the requested number of bytes from the audio
source. Note that the data is expected to be 16bit signed int format (native
byteorder) with channels interleaved.
