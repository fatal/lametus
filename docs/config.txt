Configuring lametus
-------------------

Example configuration (lines beginning with '#' are comments and not a part of
the configuration file which does not yet support comments):

# Begin a source definition. Currently only one source is supported and
# bad things will most likely happen should you try to have two source
# definitions in the configuration file.
source {

# Path to the audio device to read data from
  device "/dev/dsp"

# _Input_ samplerate. Notice that this is only the samplerate at which the
# audio source is read, not the rate used in the stream.
# Unit: Hz
  samplerate 44100

# Stereo input, most likely always a good idea (unless you're using a soundcard
# which is not capable of stereo recording).
  channels 2

# End of source definition block
}

# Begin an encoder-definition. An encoder-definition defines both encoder
# settings and "upload" settings for sending the stream to a proxy.
encoder {

# Set the samplerate used for the stream. This can differ from input samplerate
# and the audio data will be converted as needed.
# Unit: Hz
  samplerate 22050

# Set the stream to mono. The default is stereo. This does not need to be the
# same as channels in the input section, audio data will be converted as
# needed.
  mono

# Set bitrate for the stream. Setting this too low compared to the samplerate
# and mono/stereo modes will give horrid sound quality. Try different settings
# to find out what is good enough for you (or use what I used in this example,
# they are rather decent settings for music).
# Unit: kbits/s
  bitrate 32

# IP address for the stream proxy the data should be sent to. Currently only
# numeric IP addresses supported.
  serverhost "130.233.195.210"

# Port to connect to on the proxy server
  port 8000

# Password that we must send to the proxy to be recognized as a valid source
  password "reallame"

# Name of the stream
  name "#anime.fi radio (lq)"

# Genre of the stream
  genre "jpop/anime"

# URL of the stream
  url "http://www.onnanifujiyuu.org/radio/"

# Is the stream public or private.
  public 1

# End encoder-definition block
}

# Another encoder definition block
encoder {
  samplerate 44100
  mono
  bitrate 96

  serverhost "130.233.195.210"
  serverport 8000
  password "reallame"
  name "#anime.fi radio (mq)"

# Yet one more encoder block
encoder {
  samplerate 44100
