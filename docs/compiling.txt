Prerequisities
--------------

A supported OS (tested with Linux).
LAME library and header(s) (tested with version 3.89).
C compiler (tested with gcc 2.95.4).

Compiling
---------

Edit Makefile (sorry folks, I'll create some autoconf or something when I have
time), you most likely need to change LAMEDIR to point to your LAME sources
and maybe tweak CFLAGS/LDFLAGS/LIBS depending if the LAME folks have changed
something again. Then just run "make" and hope it compiles...


Installing
----------

Just copy the "lametus" binary to whatever place you see fit.
